A hands-on tutorial that teaches developers how to use Kiro IDE by building a complete full-stack QR Code Web Portal application.

## About This Tutorial

This tutorial guides users through Kiro's spec-driven development workflow, teaching core concepts and best practices while building a real-world application. By the end, users will understand how to leverage Kiro's AI-powered development environment for their own projects.

### What You'll Build

A **QR Code Web Portal** featuring:

- **Backend**: Python FastAPI REST API with QR code generation and decoding
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript single-page application with modern UI
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for both frontend and backend
- **Automation**: Agent hooks for code quality analysis and testing
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated project documentation

### What You'll Learn

#### Core Kiro Concepts

1. **Spec-Driven Development**

   - Define requirements, design, and tasks before coding
   - Generate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`
   - Use specs as living project documentation

2. **Agent Steering**

   - Guide AI behavior with project-specific instructions
   - Create product, structure, and technical guidelines
   - Customize AI coding patterns and preferences

3. **Agent Hooks**

   - Automate workflows triggered by file events
   - Set up code quality analysis
   - Implement automated testing pipelines
   - Sync documentation with code changes

4. **MCP Integration**
   - Extend Kiro with Model Context Protocol servers
   - Configure project and global MCP settings
